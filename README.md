# Project Overview

This repository contains all the source code and data generated for the PhD thesis: J. Pober, "Towards Neuro-Symbolic Symbol Grounding", PhD Thesis, King's College London, UK 2025. 

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `/.idea/` | Miscellaneous project and Git files. |
| `/data/` | All generated experiment data: 28x28 black-and-white images featuring simple shapes at different positions. |
| `/data/backup/` | Backups of various datasets. |
| `/data/inter/` | Input data for most experiments, interpolating shape positions across different images. |
| `/data/experiments/` | Output data from experiments, including feature representations of images created by traditional and property autoencoders. |
| `/data/inter/circle/` | Images of a circle moving horizontally while its y-position remains fixed. Subdirectories: `centre`, `down`, `up`. |
| `/data/inter/custom/` | Stores custom generated data, often overwritten per experiment. |
| `/data/inter/custom-CIRCLE/` | Similar to `/data/inter/custom/`, but only contains circles. |
| `/data/inter/custom_mixed/` | Contains all possible shapes in all possible positions. |
| `/data/inter/custom_square_circle/` | Like `/data/inter/custom_mixed/`, but excludes triangles. |
| `/data/inter/square/` | Similar to `/data/inter/circle/`, but uses squares instead. |
| `/data/inter/square_triangle/` | Like `/data/inter/custom_mixed/`, but excludes circles. |
| `/data/inter/triangle/` | Similar to `/data/inter/circle/`, but uses triangles instead. |
| `/data/left/` | Images of a circle moving up and down while touching the left side. |
| `/data/pairs/` | Earlier experiments with image pairs showing shape position shifts to analyze neural activity changes. |
| `/data/right/` | Images of a circle moving up and down while touching the right side. |
| `/data/simple/` | Early experiment dataset featuring circles at different positions. |
| `/histories/` | Training history of the last model run. |
| `/logs/` | Logs generated by machine learning packages. |
| `/models/` | Holds all trained models with a specific naming convention: `t.x_i-c-e`, where `t` is model type (`AE` for autoencoder, `PAE` for property-autoencoder), `x` is the experiment name, `i` is input dimension, `c` is feature vector dimension, and `e` is the number of epochs trained. |
